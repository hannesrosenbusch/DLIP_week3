import numpy as np

# Follow the tasks below to practice basic Python concepts.
# Write your code in between the dashed lines.
# Don't import additional packages. Numpy suffices.


# Task 1: 
# Instructions:
#Write a function that takes in a numpy matrix and returns its dimensions as a tuple. 

# Your code here:
# -----------------------------------------------

def compute_dimensions


# -----------------------------------------------


# Task 2: 
# Instructions:
#Write a function that takes two two-dimensional numpy matrices (input_matrix, kernel_matrix) as arguments. 
#The function should return a tuple with the dimensions of the convolution of both matrices.
#You can reuse the function above.
#The dimensions of the output (assuming no padding and a stride of one) can be computed as follows:

#(input_height - kernel_height + 1, input_width - kernel_width + 1)

# Your code here:
# -----------------------------------------------

def compute_output_size


# -----------------------------------------------


# Task 2:
# Instructions:
#Write a function that computes the convolution (no padding, stride 1) of two matrices (input_matrix, kernel_matrix).
#Your function will likely use lots of looping and you can likely reuse the functions you made above.


# Your code here:
# -----------------------------------------------
def convolute
